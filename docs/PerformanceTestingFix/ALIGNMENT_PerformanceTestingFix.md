## Project Context Analysis

### Current Project Structure

- **Project Name:** SoulMatting - Next-generation dating platform
- **Architecture:** Microservices with monorepo structure
- **Tech Stack:**
  - Frontend: React with TypeScript
  - Backend: NestJS with TypeScript
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Cache: Redis
  - Container: Docker & Docker Compose
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Package Manager: pnpm
  - Build Tool: Turbo

### Performance Testing Infrastructure

- **Lighthouse CI:** Frontend performance testing
- **Artillery:** Load testing for API endpoints
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated performance testing workflow
- **Docker Services:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Kong API Gateway

## Requirement Clarification

### Original Requirements

用戶報告 GitHub Actions 中的 **Performance Testing**
工作流程一直失敗，請求檢查並修正錯誤，並更新相關文檔。

### Specific Issues Identified

1. **pnpm Action Setup Version Inconsistency**
   - Mixed usage of `pnpm/action-setup@v4` and `pnpm/action-setup@v2`
   - Missing `run_install: false` parameter

2. **Dependency Installation Issues**
   - Missing dependency installation steps after cache restoration
   - Incomplete cache hit handling

3. **Docker Compose Service Configuration**
   - Improper service startup sequence
   - Missing health checks for dependent services
   - Inadequate wait mechanisms for service readiness

4. **Test File Path Issues**
   - Incorrect Artillery configuration file paths
   - Missing API-specific test configurations

5. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Artillery package not included in package.json
   - @faker-js/faker dependency missing for test data generation

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Fix GitHub Actions Performance Testing workflow
- Update pnpm action setup configurations
- Implement proper dependency installation and caching
- Configure Docker Compose service startup sequence
- Create missing test configuration files
- Add required dependencies to package.json
- Update documentation

### Out of Scope

- Modifying core application logic
- Changing database schema
- Updating frontend components
- Modifying API endpoints
- Performance optimization of application code

## Understanding of Existing Project

### Workflow Structure

The performance testing workflow consists of multiple jobs:

1. **setup:** Dependency and build cache management
2. **lighthouse:** Frontend performance testing
3. **load-test:** API load testing with Artillery
4. **api-performance:** Dedicated API performance testing
5. **performance-summary:** Results aggregation and reporting

### Service Dependencies

- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Redis for caching and session management
- REST API service for backend functionality
- Web application for frontend testing

### Testing Tools

- **Lighthouse CI:** Measures Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- **Artillery:** Load testing with configurable scenarios
- **Docker Compose:** Service orchestration for testing environment

## Clarification of Ambiguities

### Resolved Decisions

1. **pnpm Version:** Standardized on `pnpm/action-setup@v2` for consistency
2. **Service Startup:** Implemented sequential startup with health checks
3. **Test Configuration:** Created separate API test configuration for better organization
4. **Dependency Management:** Added Artillery and Faker to support comprehensive testing

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing Node.js and pnpm versions
- Docker Compose configuration should not affect production setup
- Test configurations should be environment-agnostic
- Performance thresholds should remain realistic for CI environment
