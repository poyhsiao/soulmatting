## Questions for Stakeholder

Before proceeding to the next phase, the following key decisions need clarification:

### High Priority Questions
1. **Technology Preferences:** Do you have preferences for specific technologies (e.g., React vs Vue, Node.js vs Python)?
2. **Matching Criteria:** What specific interests/attributes should be used for matching (hobbies, age, location, etc.)?
3. **User Verification:** What level of user verification is required (email only, phone, ID verification)?
4. **Geographic Scope:** Should the platform support location-based matching? What geographic range?
5. **Content Moderation:** What level of content moderation is needed initially?

### Medium Priority Questions
1. **File Storage:** Preference for cloud storage vs self-hosted storage?
2. **Real-time Features:** Priority order for voice vs video calling implementation?
3. **Internationalization:** Should multi-language support be considered in MVP?
4. **Analytics:** What user analytics are needed for the MVP phase?

### Low Priority Questions
