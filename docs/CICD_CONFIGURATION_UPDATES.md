## Overview

This document outlines the CI/CD configuration updates made to accommodate the current development
status of the SoulMatting platform. The changes focus on temporarily disabling CI/CD processes for
undeveloped features while maintaining code quality standards for implemented components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Changes:**

- Added `enable_service_tests` input parameter (default: `false`)
- Modified test job to conditionally skip tests for undeveloped services
- Updated E2E tests to only run when service tests are explicitly enabled

**Impact:**

- Tests for undeveloped backend services (auth, user, match) are skipped by default
- E2E tests are disabled until services are implemented
- Frontend tests and code quality checks continue to run

### 2. Security Scan Workflow (`security-scan.yml`)

**File:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

**Changes:**

- Added `enable_service_scans` input parameter (default: `false`)
- Allows manual enabling of security scans for undeveloped services

**Impact:**

- Security scans can be selectively enabled when needed
- Prevents false positives from incomplete service implementations

### 3. Performance Test Workflow (`performance-test.yml`)

**File:** `.github/workflows/performance-test.yml`

**Changes:**

- Added `enable_service_tests` input parameter (default: `false`)
- Allows conditional performance testing

**Impact:**

- Performance tests are disabled for undeveloped services
- Can be enabled as services become functional

### 4. Monitoring Workflow (`monitoring.yml`)

**File:** `.github/workflows/monitoring.yml`

**Changes:**

- Added `enable_service_monitoring` input parameter (default: `false`)
- Allows conditional monitoring setup

**Impact:**

- Monitoring checks are disabled for undeveloped services
- Prevents monitoring alerts for non-functional endpoints

## Development Stage Workflow

### New File: `development-ci.yml`

**Purpose:** Provides a lightweight CI/CD workflow specifically designed for the development stage.

**Features:**

- Code quality checks (linting, TypeScript, formatting)
- Basic security audits
- Database schema validation
- TypeScript compilation tests
- Frontend build validation
- Graceful handling of failures (continue-on-error)

**Benefits:**

- Faster feedback during development
- Focus on code quality over comprehensive testing
- Suitable for early-stage development
- Provides development status summaries

## Conditional Controls Added

### Input Parameters

| Workflow               | Parameter                   | Default | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `ci.yml`               | `enable_service_tests`      | `false` | Enable/disable service testing           |
| `security-scan.yml`    | `enable_service_scans`      | `false` | Enable/disable service security scans    |
| `performance-test.yml` | `enable_service_tests`      | `false` | Enable/disable service performance tests |
| `monitoring.yml`       | `enable_service_monitoring` | `false` | Enable/disable service monitoring        |
| `development-ci.yml`   | `run_basic_tests`           | `true`  | Enable/disable basic development tests   |

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Enable service tests manually
gh workflow run ci.yml -f enable_service_tests=true

# Run security scan with service scans enabled
gh workflow run security-scan.yml -f enable_service_scans=true -f scan_type=full_scan

# Run development CI without basic tests
gh workflow run development-ci.yml -f run_basic_tests=false
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Use Development CI:** Switch to using `development-ci.yml` for daily development work
2. **Disable Full CI:** Avoid running the full `ci.yml` workflow until services are implemented
3. **Focus on Quality:** Prioritize code quality and TypeScript compilation over comprehensive
   testing

### Development Phase Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Use development CI for code quality and basic validation
2. **Phase 2 (Service Implementation):** Gradually enable service tests as features are completed
3. **Phase 3 (Integration):** Enable full CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing
4. **Phase 4 (Production):** Activate all monitoring, security, and performance workflows

### Service-Specific Enablement

As services are developed, enable CI/CD features in this order:

1. **Auth Service:**

   ```bash
   # Enable when auth endpoints are functional
   gh workflow run ci.yml -f enable_service_tests=true
   ```

2. **User Service:**

   ```bash
   # Enable when user management is implemented
   gh workflow run security-scan.yml -f enable_service_scans=true
   ```

3. **Match Service:**
   ```bash
   # Enable when matching algorithm is ready
   gh workflow run performance-test.yml -f enable_service_tests=true
   ```

## Future Considerations

### Context7 Compliance

The current configuration aligns with Context7 standards by:

- Maintaining code quality standards
- Implementing security best practices
- Providing scalable CI/CD architecture
- Supporting gradual feature enablement

### Monitoring and Observability

When services are ready:

- Enable comprehensive monitoring workflows
- Implement distributed tracing
- Set up performance baselines
- Configure alerting thresholds

### Security Integration

As the platform matures:

- Enable SAST/DAST scanning for all services
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- Add container security scanning
- Configure compliance checks

### Performance Optimization

For production readiness:

- Enable load testing for all endpoints
- Implement performance regression detection
- Set up capacity planning metrics
- Configure auto-scaling triggers

## Conclusion

These CI/CD configuration updates provide a foundation for sustainable development while
accommodating the current state of the SoulMatting platform. The conditional controls allow for
gradual enablement of CI/CD features as the platform evolves, ensuring that development velocity is
maintained without compromising on quality standards.

The development-stage workflow provides immediate value by focusing on code quality and basic
validation, while the enhanced conditional controls in existing workflows prepare the platform for
future growth and feature implementation.
