# Example: Low severity vulnerabilities in base OS packages
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # glibc: Low severity, no known exploit, fix pending

# =============================================================================
# TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES
# =============================================================================

# Vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies where:
# 1. No direct usage of vulnerable functionality
# 2. Mitigation controls are in place
# 3. Update not available or causes breaking changes

# Example: Vulnerabilities in deep dependencies
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # lodash: Used indirectly, vulnerable function not used

# =============================================================================
# FALSE POSITIVES
# =============================================================================

# Known false positives from Trivy scanner
# These should be verified and documented

# Example: Misidentified vulnerabilities
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # False positive: Different package with same name

# =============================================================================
# ACCEPTED RISKS
# =============================================================================

# Vulnerabilities accepted by security team with documented risk assessment
# Include ticket/issue reference for tracking

# Example: Business-critical dependency with no alternative
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # Critical dependency, no alternative available (Ticket: SEC-123)

# =============================================================================
# TEMPORARY IGNORES
# =============================================================================

# Temporary ignores with expiration dates
# These should be reviewed and removed regularly

# Example: Waiting for upstream fix
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # Temporary ignore until v2.1.0 release (Expires: 2024-02-01)

# =============================================================================
# PLATFORM-SPECIFIC IGNORES
# =============================================================================

# Vulnerabilities that don't apply to our deployment environment

# Example: Windows-specific vulnerabilities in Linux containers
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # Windows-specific, not applicable to Linux containers

# =============================================================================

# 3. Include ticket/issue references for tracking
# 4. Set expiration dates for temporary ignores
# 5. Review this file monthly and remove outdated entries
# 6. Document risk assessment for accepted vulnerabilities
# 7. Prefer fixing vulnerabilities over ignoring them
